# R.U.G. aka Random Username Generator
A fork of [Username-Generator](https://github.com/purry03/Username-Generator/) with extra functionalities.
## What is  [Username-Generator](https://github.com/purry03/Username-Generator/) ?
A simple python script created by [purry03](https://github.com/purry03) that combines one adjective with one noun and adds a number between 1 and 99 to the end to generate random usernames.
Possible number of distinct usernames is 850 million.

A sample of usernames generated : 
```
ColorfulPod95
Big-HeartedPrefix36
PrivateThing58
PoisedStatute39
IdolizedOverclocking77      
ShadowyLabourer12
```
## What's new?
We made the script more functional with added features such as auto copy usernames to the clipboard and multiple text generation directly when you call the script rather than having a prompt asking you how many usernames do you want, so basically we removed an extra step you had to do.

For example :

```
$ generate 5
--> huskyLiquidity67
--> slightTreasury3
--> stainedBoundary94
--> equalFlu74
--> insubstantialMasonry71
```
